# ddf-pipeline

ddf-pipeline carries out several iterations of direction-dependent
self-calibration on your LOFAR imaging data using DDFacet and KillMS
For more on KillMS see Tasse 2014a,b
(http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1410.8706T
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...566A.127T) and Smirnov &
Tasse 2015 (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.449.2668S); for
DDFacet see Tasse et al 2017 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02078). The objective of ddf-pipeline is to
fully reduce LOFAR (continuum, Stokes I) imaging data to a
science-ready state with no human intervention. ddf-pipeline is
currently in use by the LOFAR Surveys KSP for reduction of the LoTSS
survey (Shimwell et al 2017
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...598A.104S).

ddf-pipeline was written by Martin Hardcastle, Tim Shimwell, Cyril
Tasse and Wendy Williams and is described by Shimwell et al (2019 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...622A...1S/abstract) and Tasse et al (2021 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021A%26A...648A...1T/abstract).
